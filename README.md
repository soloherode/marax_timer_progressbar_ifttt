# marax_timer_progressbar_IFTTT

***This is a fork of the marax_timer from alexrus. This fork included a progress bar for the shot timer to indicate the optimal shot duration. This allows even amateurs to achieve repeatable espresso results - and it looks nice :) 

An IFTTT webhook was integrated that sends a notification to your smartphone when the machine is turned on (this comes in handy if you use a smartplug to control your machine remotely) and a second notification when the machine has reached an optimal temperature (due to long heating times > 25 mins).***

For hardware descriptions have a look at the original marax_timer readme. 

Progress Bar Shot Timer

The progress bar will be at 100% after 25 seconds.
